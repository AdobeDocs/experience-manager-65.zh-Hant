# 與Adobe Creative Cloud共用資料夾 {#folder-sharing-with-adobe-creative-cloud}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>AEM至Creative Cloud資料夾共用功能已過時。 建議客戶使用較新的功能，例如 [Adobe資產連結](https://helpx.adobe.com/tw/enterprise/using/adobe-asset-link.html) 或 [AEM案頭應用程式](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-desktop-app/using/using.html?lang=en). 進一步瞭解 [AEM與Creative Cloud整合最佳實務](/help/assets/aem-cc-integration-best-practices.md).

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets lets you share folders containing assets with Adobe Creative Cloud users. For details on how to configure Adobe Marketing Cloud to let you share assets with Adobe Creative Cloud, see [Configuring Assets-Creative Cloud integration](/help/sites-administering/configure-assets-cc-integration.md).

1. In the Assets console, select a folder to share with Creative Cloud.
